# 🍎 Fruit Classification with CNN (PyTorch)

Image classifier built with **PyTorch** to distinguish between:

- Apple only  
- Orange only  
- Banana only  
- Mixed fruits

---

## 📂 Dataset

- `Train.zip`: training data (can be modified)  
- `Test.zip`: test data (must remain unchanged)

---

## 🛠️ Approach

To improve model accuracy, the following strategies were applied:

- Balanced class distributions  
- Corrected mislabelled samples  
- Resized images uniformly  
- Used image augmentation to expand training data  
- Tuned CNN architecture and hyperparameters
